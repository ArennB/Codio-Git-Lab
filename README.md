# The Caesar cipher is one of the simplest and most widely known encryption techniques. Named after Julius Caesar, who is reputed to have used it to 
# communicate with his generals, this cipher is a type of substitution cipher in which each letter in the plaintext is shifted a certain number of places down or up the alphabet.

# How It Works:
# 1. Choose a Shift Amount: First, you select a number that will be used as the shift or key. For example, with a shift of 3, then every letter in your message will be moved three places down the alphabet.
# 2. Apply the Shift: Each letter in the plaintext is replaced by a letter some fixed number of positions down the alphabet. For instance, with a shift of 3, A becomes D, B becomes E, C becomes F, and so on.
# 3. Wrap Around: The alphabet wraps around at the end. This means that if a letter shifts beyond 'Z', it goes back to the beginning of the alphabet. For example, with a shift of 3, X becomes A, Y becomes B, and Z becomes C.
